I am a sophomore majoring in computer science and environmental studies. I am interested in a career related to climate science and solutions, or some kind of work combining the environment with 
data and computer science. I took this course because I feel like it combines my interests well and will allow me to begin exploring the different ways of analyzing environmental data. My hobbies 
include running, biking, being outdoors, and cooking.
