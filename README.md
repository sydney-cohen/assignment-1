Sydney Cohen

I am a sophomore majoring in computer science and environmental studies. I am interested in a career related to climate science, or some kind of work combining the environment with 
data and computer science. I am passionate about finding climate solutions, and I hope to make it a significant part of my career in the future, or at least to make an impact on the environment 
with my career.I took this course because I feel like it combines my interests well and will allow me to begin exploring the different ways of analyzing environmental data. My hobbies include 
running, biking, being outdoors, and cooking.
